Legacy OpenStudio 
==========

The Legacy OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in makes it easy to create and edit the building geometry in your [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) input files. This free plug-in also allows you to launch EnergyPlus simulations and view the results without leaving the SketchUp 3D drawing program

Note that active development has moved from the Legacy OpenStudio Plug-in to the more comprehensive [OpenStudio](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio) suite of tools and libraries. Changes to the Legacy OpenStudio Plug-in will be limited to bug fixes and compatibility updates for new versions of EnergyPlus.

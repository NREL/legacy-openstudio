Legacy OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in
==========

The Legacy OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in makes it easy to create and edit the building geometry in your [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) input files. This free plug-in also allows you to launch EnergyPlus simulations and view the results without leaving the SketchUp 3D drawing program

Note that active development has moved from the Legacy OpenStudio Plug-in to the more comprehensive [OpenStudio](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio) suite of tools and libraries. Changes to the Legacy OpenStudio Plug-in will be limited to bug fixes and compatibility updates for new versions of EnergyPlus.

The Legacy OpenStudio Plug-in was created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy as an interface to the EnergyPlus simulation engine. Refer to the EnergyPlus webpage at [energyplus.gov](http://energyplus.gov) for an overview of the concept and features.

User support is available via the community moderated question and answer resource [unmethours.com](https://unmethours.com/questions/).

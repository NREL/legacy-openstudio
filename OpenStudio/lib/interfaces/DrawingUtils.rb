  # Big kludge:
  # When a face is divided into two faces such that the smaller face cuts into the original face,
  # e.g., changing the original vertice count from 4 to 8, the entity object assignments will
  # often become swapped.  For example, the 8 vertex face is now considered the 'new entity' and
  # the smaller face is assigned to the original entity.  This is a problem when trying to detect
  # windows and doors that are added.
  # Solution is that both faces will share the same drawing interface at this point.  The task is
  # to identify which is which.

# breaks rule of only looking at entities..but it has to.
  # Checks only the case of swapping a sub_face with a base_face.

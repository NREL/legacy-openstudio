module UI

  # Executes a system command, e.g., "dir", "cd c:/xyz", "copy a b", etc.
  # Other Ruby methods such as 'exec' or 'system' by themselves do not seem to work well.
  # TIPS:
  #   Commands don't always work the way they do in the MS-DOS shell window, best to experiment to find what works.
  #   Use 'start' or 'cmd' to launch a new shell that will stay open.
  #   Use 'call xyz.html' to open a file in a new default web browser.
  #   Use double quotes around file paths with spaces.
  #   Both file separators \ and / are accepted.  Make sure to double up on the \\.
  #   Use '&&' to put multiple commands in the same string, e.g., "dir && pause"  NOTE:  Doesn't seem to work for all commands.

  # This a cross-platform way to open a file outside of SketchUp, e.g., text, html, pdf, etc.
  # The system file associations determine which program to use to open the file.
  # This is an alternative to using UI.openURL which always hijacks whatever browser is open
  # on the users desktop on Windows.  UI.openURL does not seem to work at all on the Mac.

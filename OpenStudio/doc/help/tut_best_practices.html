<H2>Best Practices</H2>
<br>

<H3>General Guidelines</H3>
<div style="margin-left:10px">
<ul>
    <li>A common frustration to users is that the link between IDF and SKP files may become corrupt. Future versions of OpenStudio are expected to provide better integration with the SKP file. In the meantime, don't save your project as an SKP file, rely solely on saving the IDF file instead. When you come back to it at a later date, open SketchUp without opening any SKP file and then re-open the IDF.  </li>
    <li>Leave North in SketchUp at 0 degrees. If your building isn't aligned with true north, then rotate the geometry as necessary. To aid in this you can create a new set of axis with a unique origin and rotation. <br><a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/Google/Google%20SketchUp%207/Plugins/OpenStudio/doc/new/tut_rotating.html">Here is a link to a tutorial on rotating an axes.</a></li>
    <li>When you import an IDF into OpenStudio it may be altered as part of the import process. For example if your windows are not in the same plane as their base-surface, OpenStudio moves them into the base-surface plane. There may be other changes as well. As a result, if you want to keep your raw IDF untouched, you should either "SaveAs" as soon as you import it, or copy it prior to import</li>
    <li>If you want to rename objects, go to the Object Info dialog, don't alter the names  in SketchUp's Entity Information dialog.</li>
    <li>Don't use the paint bucket tool on EnergyPlus surfaces and sub-surfaces. If you do, it will be re-painted again by OpenStudio.</li>
    <li>The Object Info Window only works on one object at a time. If you select multiple objects or surfaces and make a change, it will only affect one of those selected objects.</li>
    <li>The Object Info Window doesn't take data until you tab to the next field or click elsewhere in the window.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<H3>Guidelines for Zones</H3>
<div style="margin-left:10px">
<ul>
    <li>Zones should be top level objects. Don't combine multiple zones into a group or component.</li>
    <li>Name your zones, to make large models easier to manage and search through. At times you may want to name your surfaces and sub-surfaces.</li>
    <li>Geometry within a zone should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set" target="_blank">convex</a>.</li>
    <li>Do not scale a zone using the scale tool. The only workflow where you need the scale tool is to scale an Output:Illuminance Map. If you scale a Zone your data will be incorrect.</li>
	<li>Zone Origins don't move once they are set. You can move the SketchUp group but it won't move the zone origin. If you want to move the Zone origin you need to edit the IDF file elsewhere. You can however set the  zone rotation through the OpenStudio Object Info Window.</li>
	<li>Creating a new zone or shading group requires the user to double-click the group to edit it instead of automatically opening for edit when the group is placed.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<H3>Guidelines for Surfaces</H3>
<div style="margin-left:10px">
<ul>
	<li>Don't group a selection of EnergyPlus surfaces or sub-surfaces together. All surfaces under a zone should be un-grouped.</li>
    <li>Exterior walls should generally be modeled to the outside face of the wall.</li>
    <li>Ideally Interior walls would be drawn to the centerline of the interior wall, but you should be fine if you just pick one edge or the other, so long as you are consistent with adjacent zones. Surfaces for adjacent zones must not overlap each other.</li>
    <li>A surface may be divided into two by drawing a line across the face.</li>
    <li>Deleting a surface by erasing a shared edge with another surface does not update the sub-surfaces of the deleted surface to point to the new base surface. Try to avoid this, but if you have to do it you can delete one edge of the sub-surface to remove it and then redraw the edge to create a new sub-surface assigned to the correct surface.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<H3>Guidelines for Sub-Surfaces</H3>
<div style="margin-left:10px">
<ul>
	<li>Don't place a sub-surface (window or door) inside of  another sub-surface.</li>
    <li>You also don't want to place two sub-surfaces right against each other. Place a small space between them.</li>
    <li>Don't make a window the size of an entire base surface. Use <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=94870" target="_new">SketchUp's Offset Tool</a> to inset the sub-surface some nominal amount.</li>
    <li>You cannot draw a sub-surface that shares two edges with a base surface, this will create a new base surface. You can draw a window at the edge of wall, but not at the edge as well as the roof or floor.</li>
    <li>You can delete a sub-surface either by removing all the edges one at a time or by double-clicking to select the face and edges and then deleting. Do not delete the face only (this leaves a visual hole in the base surface).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<H3>Guidelines for Shading Surfaces</H3>
<div style="margin-left:10px">
<ul>
    <li>If you try to draw a zone shading surface in line with the roof it will be recognized as a roof. If you do want a zone shading surface in line with the roof you first have to draw it lower, and then move it up into place.</li>
    <li>Shading surfaces also cannot be draw while touching the floor. Similar to above, you would draw them smaller and then stretch them down the floor.This could occur on vertical fins</li>
    <li>You can also create shading surfaces as part of a shading group vs. drawing them as surfaces inside of a zone.</li>
</ul>

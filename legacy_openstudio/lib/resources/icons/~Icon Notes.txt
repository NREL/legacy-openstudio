Icon Notes
----------


Toolbar buttons are 24x24 (large) or 16x16 (small) PNG image files with alpha.

Custom toolbars on the Mac do not appear to be dockable and only use the 24x24 size.


Best to draw the icons as 24x24 images (using IcoFX is great) than automatically create the 
16x16 images from those.



Cursors must be in TIFF format (which is inconvenient)

Cursor size is 16x16?  Seems bigger on the Mac?


To finally get the alpha preserved in the TIFF, I created the icon as a PNG (I forget how).
Then on the Mac, I opened the PNG using Core Image Fun House (in Developer Tools) and saved it again as TIFF, and it just worked.
The Preview program works just as well...simply double-click the PNG and do save as TIFF.
The PNG already had the alpha layer though.


Hmmm...not so hard this time.
Just started with another existing ICO file, made my edits, then wrote out the PNG using Export Image (IcoFX).
